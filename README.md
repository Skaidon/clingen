# Purpose

- Play with newer React concepts like Context.
  - Hooks doesn't make sense for this experiment.
- Play with various UI React components that Ihaven't had a chance to utilize during my full-time job.
  - `react-aria-tabpanel` for the tabs.
    - Chosen for it's accessibility features.
      - Select a tab, use you left/right arrow keys to switch tabs.
  - `react-awesome-popover` for the popover hover copy.
    - Chosen because it allowed me to style everythign quickly.
  - `react-css-grid` for the multi column layouts.
    - Chosen because I haven't had an opportunity to use CSS Grid yet.
